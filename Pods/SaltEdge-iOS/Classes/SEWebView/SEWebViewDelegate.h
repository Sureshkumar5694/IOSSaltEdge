 Invoked when a callback is triggered from the Salt Edge Connect page.

 @param webView The web view which displays the Salt Edge Connect page from which the callback is triggered.
 @param response The payload within the callback. It contains three keys: "login_id", "secret" and "state". Note that if the login is duplicated, you will receive a payload with the key "duplicated_login_id" and the "state" being "error". See an example response above.
